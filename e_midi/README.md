# e_midi - Interactive MIDI Player

e_midi is more than a simple midi player.  It currently supports .mid and .xml files.
MusicXML support is very alpha and if you're interested, PRs are welcome!

now includes .ogg and .mp3 embedding/playing via rodio.  mp4/webm embed but do not play yet.

> **Additional Binary:**
>
> - **e_midi_demo01**: Windows-only demo for window focus, resize, and move event integration with e_grid IPC. Useful for testing advanced window event handling and IPC features. Source: `examples/demo_focus_resize_move.rs`.
>
> **To run:**
> ```cmd
> cargo run --bin e_midi_demo01
> ```
> or after building:
> ```cmd
> target\release\e_midi_demo01.exe
> ```
>
> ---
>
> **Running after install:**
>
> After installing with:
> ```cmd
> cargo install e_midi
> ```
> you can run the main player binary directly as `e_midi` from your terminal or command prompt.  `e_midi_demo01` is also installed and should be available for your use.
>
> **Note:** The default `e_midi` binary/lib includes the curated MIDI sound effects from the `midi` folder within the repository, embedded at build time. These static songs are always available, even if you run the binary outside the repository directory.

A feature-rich, interactive MIDI player written in Rust with advanced playback options, looping capabilities, and scan modes.

> - **e_midi_demo02**: Persistent IPC event listener demo. Launches e_midi to play song 0 with IPC enabled, then displays all incoming MIDI note events in real time. Remains running and will display events from any e_midi instance with IPC enabled. Useful for debugging and monitoring event flow. Source: `examples/e_midi_demo02.rs`.

> - **e_midi_ipc_player**: Designed to be controlled entirely via inter-process communication. Tt listens for IPC midi events and plays the notes with a changing random voice.  run `e_midi_demo02`, then start as many `e_midi_ipc_player` as you desire; they will all play the same song.

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- A MIDI output device or software synthesizer
- MIDI files to play

### Building from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davehorner/e_midi.git
cd e_midi
cargo build --release
```

### Running
```bash
cargo run
```

## Usage

### Interactive Menu
The application starts with an interactive configuration menu:

1. **Loop Configuration**: Choose playlist and/or individual song looping
2. **Delay Settings**: Configure pause duration between songs
3. **Playback Mode Selection**: Choose from 4 different playback modes

### Song Selection
The player maintains a unified song index where:
- **Static songs** (compiled-in from `midi/`) appear first (indexes 0-N)
- **Dynamic songs** (runtime-loaded) appear after static songs (indexes N+1 onwards)
- Song selection by index works seamlessly across both types
- Static songs provide guaranteed availability and optimal performance

### Track and BPM Selection
When playing songs, you can:
- **Track Selection**: Enter track numbers (e.g., "1,3,5") or press Enter for all tracks
- **BPM Override**: Enter a custom BPM or press Enter to use the MIDI's default tempo

## Command Line Interface

### Overview
e_midi provides both interactive and command-line modes. The CLI allows for scripting, automation, and integration with other tools.

**Important**: Global options must come before the subcommand (e.g., `e_midi --delay-between-songs 5 play-random`), while subcommand-specific options come after the subcommand (e.g., `e_midi scan --mode 2 --duration 45`).

## Song Management

### Static vs Dynamic Songs
The e_midi player uses a hybrid approach for managing MIDI content:

#### Static Songs (Compiled-In)
- **Build-time Processing**: MIDI and MusicXML files (`.mid`, `.xml`, `.musicxml`) in the `midi/` directory are processed at compile time by `build.rs`
- **Embedded Data**: Song data is compiled directly into the executable for fast access
- **Index Priority**: Static songs appear first in the song index (positions 0-N)
- **Performance**: Zero I/O overhead during playback - all data is in memory
- **Use Case**: Core repertoire, frequently played songs, or embedded deployments

#### Dynamic Songs (Runtime Loading)
- **Runtime Discovery**: Additional MIDI files can be loaded at runtime from specified directories
- **Flexible Content**: Add new songs without recompilation
- **Index Continuation**: Dynamic songs appear after static songs in the index (positions N+1 onwards)
- **File I/O**: Loaded on-demand with minimal caching
- **Use Case**: Experimental content, large libraries, or user-provided files

The player seamlessly handles both types, with static songs providing guaranteed availability and performance, while dynamic songs offer flexibility for expanding the music library.

## Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

### iceoryx2 Integration
e_midi includes built-in IPC capabilities using the iceoryx2 framework for lock-free, zero-copy communication:

#### Communication Features
- **Real-time Events**: Playback status, song changes, progress updates
- **Remote Control**: Play, stop, pause, next/previous, tempo control via IPC
- **State Synchronization**: Song lists, playback state, window management
- **Grid Integration**: Future support for e_grid pattern-based control

#### Ecosystem Integration
- **e_grid**: Pattern-based MIDI triggering and sequencing
- **State Server**: Centralized state management across e_* applications
- **Multi-instance**: Multiple e_midi instances can coordinate playback
- **External Control**: Third-party applications can control playback via IPC

#### Event Types
- **MIDI Commands**: Play, stop, pause, resume, tempo changes
- **Status Updates**: Playback started/stopped, song changes, progress
- **System Events**: Heartbeats, shutdown coordination, state requests

The IPC system enables e_midi to function as both a standalone player and a component in larger musical ecosystems.

## Configuration

### Build-time Configuration
The application processes MIDI files at build time using `build.rs`. Place your MIDI files in the project directory and they will be automatically processed and embedded.

### Runtime Configuration
- **Loop Settings**: Configure at startup
- **Scan Duration**: Default 30 seconds, configurable per session
- **Delay Between Songs**: 0-‚àû seconds, configurable
- **Track Selection**: Per-song basis during playback

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Build Script**: Processes MIDI files and generates Rust code at compile time
- **Event Timeline**: Converts MIDI events to a timeline-based playback system
- **Non-blocking Input**: Allows user interaction during playback
- **Accurate Timing**: Precise millisecond-level timing for faithful MIDI reproduction
- **IPC Layer**: iceoryx2-based inter-process communication for ecosystem integration
- **Hybrid Storage**: Compile-time embedded songs + runtime dynamic loading

### MIDI Processing
- Supports standard MIDI files (SMF)
- Handles multiple tracks and channels
- Preserves original timing and velocity information
- Automatic tempo calculation and BPM override support

### Dependencies
- `midir`: MIDI I/O operations
- `midly`: MIDI file parsing
- `rimd`: Additional MIDI utilities
- `ansi_term`: Terminal color output
- `iceoryx2`: Lock-free inter-process communication
- `ratatui`: Terminal user interface framework
- `crossterm`: Cross-platform terminal manipulation

## Troubleshooting

### No MIDI Output
Ensure you have a MIDI output device available:
- **Windows**: Built-in software synthesizer or external MIDI device
- **macOS**: Built-in audio or external MIDI interface
- **Linux**: ALSA, JACK, or PulseAudio MIDI support

### Build Issues
If you encounter build errors:
1. Ensure all MIDI files are valid
2. Check that dependencies are up to date: `cargo update`
3. Clean and rebuild: `cargo clean && cargo build`

### Playback Issues
- **No sound**: Verify MIDI output device and volume settings
- **Timing issues**: Check system audio latency settings
- **Crash during playback**: Ensure MIDI files are not corrupted
